Scenario: Fashion Forward Forecasting
You've recently joined "StyleSense", a rapidly growing online women's clothing retailer, as a data scientist. StyleSense is known for its trendy and affordable fashion, and its customer base has exploded in recent months. This influx of new customers is fantastic for business, but it has created a challenge: a backlog of product reviews with missing data. Customers are still leaving valuable feedback in the text of their reviews, but they aren't always indicating whether they recommend the product.

Your first task at StyleSense is to leverage the existing data– those reviews with complete information – to build a predictive model.

This model will analyze the text of a review, the customer's age, the product category, and other relevant information to predict whether or not the customer would recommend the product. By automating this process, you'll help StyleSense gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction, identify trending products, and ultimately provide a better shopping experience for their growing customer base.

The future of fashion forecasting is in your hands!

Instructions

You will be using the provided data to create a machine learning model pipeline.
You must handle the data appropriately in your pipeline to predict whether or not a customer would recommend a product based on the other features. Note the data includes numerical, categorical, and text data.
You should ensure you properly train and evaluate your model.


TASKS:
* Create preprocessing steps for the proper data types to be used in a model pipeline
* Create steps for processing text data to be used in a model pipeline
* Create steps for creating features from text data to be used in a model pipeline
* Create a model pipeline that combines your processing, feature engineering, and model prediction steps
* Fine-tune your model pipeline to find optimal hyperparameters for your model
* Evaluate with test data your final model pipeline after being trained with all the training data
